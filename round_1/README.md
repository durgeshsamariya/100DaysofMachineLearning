# 100 Days of Machine Learning Round 1

## Day 0 | January 18, 2021

D-Day is here and finally, I am accepting 100 days of machine learning code challenge.

On 16 Jan, 2021, I am accepting a challenge, which is “100-Days-Of-Machine-Learning-Code” and the intuition behind this to dedicate at least one hour of every day for next 100 days in studying and/or coding Machine Learning.
